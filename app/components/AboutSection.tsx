          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Nestled in the heart of Brisbane, The Daily Grind Café was founded with one mission — to bring people together
            over a cup of quality, locally-sourced coffee. We’re not just your morning stop — we’re your neighborhood living room.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Every brew we serve is made with love, passion, and ethically-sourced beans. Whether you’re here for a quick
            flat white or a slow Sunday brunch, you’re part of the Daily Grind family.
